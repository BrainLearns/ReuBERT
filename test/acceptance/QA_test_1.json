    "At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later.",
    "Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance,",

    "Such theories are often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period."
