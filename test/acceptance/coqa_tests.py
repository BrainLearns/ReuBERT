    "William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616)[a] was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded ",
    "as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's greatest dramatist.[2][3][4] He is often called England's national poet and "
    "the \"Bard of Avon\".[5][b] His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays,[c] 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, "
    "and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than "
    "those of any other playwright.[7] Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with "
    "whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, "
    "and part-owner of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to"
    " Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters "
    "as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others.[8][9][10] Such theories are "
    "often criticised for failing to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period. Shakespeare produced most of his known works between "
    "1589 and 1613.[11][12][d] His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best work produced in these genres. Until about "
    "1608, he wrote mainly tragedies, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in the English language.[2][3][4] "
    "In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) and collaborated with other playwrights. Many of Shakespeare's plays were published "
    "in editions of varying quality and accuracy in his lifetime. However, in 1623, two fellow actors and friends of Shakespeare's, John Heminges and Henry Condell, "
    "published a more definitive text known as the First Folio, a posthumous collected edition of Shakespeare's dramatic works that included all but two of his plays."
    "[13] The volume was prefaced with a poem by Ben Jonson, in which Jonson presciently hails Shakespeare in a now-famous quote as \"not of an age, but for all time\".[13]"
    "Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries, Shakespeare's works have been continually adapted and rediscovered by new movements in scholarship and performance. His plays remain "
    "popular and are studied, performed, and reinterpreted through various cultural and political contexts around the world."]

            " Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept. " \
            "But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy " \
            "and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one " \
            "in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's" \
            " mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. " \
            "So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like " \
            "them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. \"What are you doing, Cotton?!\" \"I only wanted to be more like you\"." \
            "Cotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said \"Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, " \
            "like you. We would never want you to be any other way. And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her " \
            "up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her " \
            "sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. \"Don't ever do that again, Cotton!\" they " \
            "all cried. \"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that! " \
            "Then Cotton thought, \"I change my mind. I like being special\"."
