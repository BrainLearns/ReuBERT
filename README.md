# Thales-Bert

## Setup

### Virtual Environment

You must first setup a **Python 3.6** virtualenv.
1. Install virtual environments: `pip install virtualenv`.
1. Create the "env" virtual environment in the root of the project: `virtualenv env -p python3`.
1. You may now activate it as needed, and configure the new virtualenv in your IDE: `source env/bin/activate`.
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt.`

### Set up pre-commit hooks (only if you intend to develop and push new commits)

1. Ensure that the virtual environment's name is "env". 
1. Modify your local git configuration to point the correct emplacement of the project hooks
    > Run the following command in the terminal at the project root: 
            
    `git config core.hookspath .githooks`
1. Everytime you create a new commit, you shall see the output of yapf execution which reformats all source files properly. 

### Fine-tuning BERT on the SQuAD dataset in the cloud on a TPU

See the steps 1 and 2 in the cloud directory's [README.md](cloud_scripts/README.md).

You may skip this step if a member of your team already did this step, as it is compute-intensive and costly.

\# TODO: Google Drive link or other link for the data folder.

### Download the fine-tuned BERT's weights for local CPU usage of the model

See the steps 3, 4 and 5 in the cloud directory's [README.md](cloud_scripts/README.md). Basically, you need to download the trained BERT model and place it at some place under the `./thales-bert-gcp-bucket` directory here.

### Download Spacy NLP model
 
Run `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm` in the virtual environment to setup the spacy dependency. 

### Run tests

Once install, verify your installation by running tests within the virtualenv using the command `./run_tests.sh` when placed in the root of the project.

### Enjoy

You can now run the main, such as by doing `python main.py`, to use the Question-Answering chatbot.

### Exemple usage

input text : `"William Shakespeare was an English poet, playwright and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English 
language and the world's greatest dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\".
"His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 39 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, 
and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language 
and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.\n Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon,
Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna and twins Hamnet 
and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner 
of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men. At age 49 (around 1613), he 
appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive;
this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious
beliefs, and whether the works attributed to him were written by others. Such theories are often criticised for failing 
to adequately note that few records survive of most commoners of the period."`
